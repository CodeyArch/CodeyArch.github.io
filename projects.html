                <p><strong> Strengths of this project: </strong> Allows me to experiment with different game designs and to get used to how mobile game dev for android works.
                    It has the potential to be a great product and it's fun to make.</p>
                <p> <strong>Weaknesses of this project: </strong> A large sum of this project involves art, something I am not too good at. You will find in
                    this project that I use fairly basic pixel art to get the job done as that is what I am most comfortable working with.</p>
                <p> <strong>Software involved: </strong> Unity game engine, Visual studio code, Aseprite</p>
                <p> <strong>Where you can find it: </strong> Currently neither the source code or app is public</p>

                <h2>Same Level Prototype:</h2>
                <p><strong>Description: </strong>This is a project made early 2021 when I was learning some new skills in game development.
                    The game is simply the same level but with many twists. What this entails is the first level repeating over
                    and over but each time a new change happens. This change can range from inverted controls, player sizes, reduce visibility
                    and many more. The game is perfect for speedrunning but can also be played casually.</p>

                <p><strong>Strengths of this project: </strong> A wide range of different mechanics all in one game. This truly allowed me to flex my creative
                    muscles when it came to gameplay and it produced a really fun game.</p>
                <p><strong>Weaknesses of this project: </strong> Graphics. I threw the idea of graphics out the window with this project and focused solely on making
                    everything as fun as possible. If I should do a project similar to this again then I shall take more care with graphics.</p>
                <p><strong>Software involved: </strong> Unity game engine, Visual tudio code</p>
                <p><strong>Where you can find it: </strong> The original source code got corrupted during a OneDrive backup. The game itself, however, can

                <h2>Spring Time Sunflower (Game Jam Edition)</h2>
                <p><strong>Description: </strong> A game made in less than 24 hours due to me joining the Spring Jam 2021 a bit late. All parts of this game
                    were done by me, including the music and graphics. The game involves moving your sunflower left and right, collecting water but
                    avoiding salt. Once your flower grows to a certain size, you have the opportunity to retire that flower to the fields and begin anew,
                    resetting your score but gaining a multiplier boost. It has a very high risk/reward system despite it's simplistic gameplay and it's certainly
                    a fun way to kill some time, trying to get absurd scores </p>

                <p><strong>Strengths of this project: </strong> The game was made in 24 hours and has no major bugs. The gameplay is simple but it's really fun!
                    I like how this project turned out and would certainly like to do something similar again </p>
                <p><strong>Weaknesses of this project: </strong> The music and graphics. I was brand new to pixel art and music making for this jam and there was a
                    restriction that you couldn't use any premade graphics/audio. I gave it my best shot but on a future project I would love to improve these areas. </p>
