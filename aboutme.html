            <h3>About Codey Arch</h3>
            <p>I am a student that has built a strong academic career in computer science. Currently studying Level 3 Computing BTEC, I am on track to leave
            the year with a D/D/D. </p>
            <p>My motivation lies in the fact that I want to build a successful career and pursue my own goals. I work to ensure that all my
            projects are fully functional with as little unintended features as possible</p>
            <p>My main experience lies in game development and design but I have a passion for many fields in computing, whether it be web development,
            game mods or networking. I aim to gain as much experience as I can so that I can be a useful asset on any team.</p>
            <p>When I work in a team, I build a strong connection with my teammates that allows me to work well. I enjoy getting to know my team members
            and learning about the goals of any business I work with. </p>
            <h2>Game Design and Development</h2>
            <p>I make use of the Unity game engine for all my games. As a result, I have built some experience using c# and have learnt more
            about object oriented programming. </p>
            <p>I intent to make games that are fun to play above all else. Where I may be lacking in graphics, I make up for in enjoyment. As of
            current, all my game projects have been made for me to enjoy and gain experience. </p>
            <p>Through being both the designer and developer of my games, I have been able to squash many technical challenges early on, leading
            to less problems further down the line. I believe this is an important approach to take because it allows for you to be able to do
            more as an individual in less time. I enjoy both design and development and i'm looking forward to using my skills in more projects in future</p>
